Written using Visual Studio Community 2017 Version 15.4.4 (Console App: .NET Framework)</br>
-Download the repo and open with Visual Studio</br>
-Press the "Start" button to run</br>
</br>
</br>
Assumptions:</br>
-That the string can be encapsulated by 0 to many sets of parenthesis</br>
-That the items will always be separated by commas, even it if wasn't...that could be changed in Line 18 of DashAssigner.cs</br>
-That the string input only needs to be changed in the code and not through a console ui</br>
-That the input will always be string and not objects or any other datatype</br>
-That parenthesis will always be used to illustrate the different levels of separations (the number of dashes in before the word)</br>
</br>
</br>
Future Improvements:</br>
-Account for different datatype inputs besides String</br>
-Try to do it recursively</br>
-Create a simple console UI to specify the input String</br>
-Implement error handling</br>
-Utilize a dictionary to provide order
